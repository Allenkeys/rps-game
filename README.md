ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

A console game which would be enhanced leter in the course of my learning.
The game accepts user input and generate random input for the computer and determine the winner at every given throw.

Scores of both players are updated at every given throw and logged to the console.
After five consecutive throw, the scores are used to determine the game winner.

Every update to this project will appear here...
